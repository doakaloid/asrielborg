AsrielBorg is a clone of SeeBorg, an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) bot created by Eugene Bujak in C++. AsrielBorg is written to work with Discord and Node.js 7.10.0. AsrielBorg is a bot that can learn from other users and formulate responses according to the contexts that the bot already knows. It is not coherent most of the time, but it does provide for some good entertainment.

### Installation
   1. Install Node.js 7.10.0: (Download: https://nodejs.org/en/)
   2. Create a Discord bot. (Guide: https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
   3. Run ```Install.bat``` to install the dependencies.
   4. Run ```Start.bat``` to start your bot so that it can generate a config file.
   5. Edit the newly generated ```config.json``` file and enter your bot token in the ```token``` field.
   6. Run ```Start.bat``` to start your bot.
