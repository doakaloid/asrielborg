AsrielBorg is a clone of SeeBorg, an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) bot created by Eugene Bujak in C++. AsrielBorg is written to work with Discord and Node.js 6.5.0. AsrielBorg is a bot that can learn from other users and formulate responses according to the contexts that the bot already knows. It is not coherent most of the time, but it does provide for some good entertainment.

**IF YOU ARE UPDATING TO >1.0.0, YOU MUST INSTALL NODE.JS 6.5.0**

### Installation
   1. Install Node.js 6.5.0: (Download: https://nodejs.org/en/)
   2. Create a Discord bot. (Guide: https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
   3. Edit the ```token``` field in ```config.json``` and insert the token for your bot.
   4. Run the bot with the command ```node main.js```.
   5. If you do enable the webpanel, access http://127.0.0.1:```port``` to set a password, **otherwise anyone else will be able to set it.**
